## Introduction

Differences in disease risk between individuals are often caused by genetic
variants. Identifying the effects of genetic variants is key to understanding disease phenotypes and their underlying biology. The effects of variants in many single-gene disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, are generally well-characterized
and their disease biology well understood. For example, in cystic fibrosis,
mutations in the coding region of the CFTR gene alter the three-dimensional structure of the chloride channel proteins in epithelial cells, affecting not
only chloride transport, but also sodium and potassium transport in the lungs, 
pancreas and skin. The path from gene mutation to altered protein to disease 
phenotype is relatively simple and well understood.

In cystic fibrosis, mutations in the coding region of the CFTR gene result in a defective protein, leading to excess mucus production that can damage the lungs and digestive system.](fig/single-gene-disease.png){alt="Single gene disorder"}

The most common human disorders, however, involve many genes interacting with
each other and with the environment, a far more complicated path to follow than
the path from a single gene mutation to its protein to a disease phenotype. Cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes and cancer
involve a complex interplay of genes with environment, and their mechanisms are 
not well understood. One method of understanding the relationship between genetic
variants and disease is a "Genome-wide association study (GWAS), which associates
genetic variants with disease traits. It is tempting to think that these genetic
variants would fall in coding regions. However, most GWAS variants for common 
diseases like diabetes are located in **non-coding** regions of the genome. 
These variants are therefore likely to fall in regulatory sequences which are 
involved in gene regulation.

Gene regulation controls the quantity, timing and locale of gene expression. 
Analyzing the association between gene expression and genetic variants is known as 
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. eQTL mapping searches for
associations between the expression of one or more genes and a genetic locus.
Specifically, genetic variants underlying eQTL peak explain some of the 
variation in gene expression levels. eQTL studies can reveal the architecture 
of quantitative traits, connect DNA sequence variation to phenotypic variation,
and shed light on transcriptional regulation and regulatory variation.
Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and association mapping can be 
applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts) in eQTL analysis,
such that gene expression can be mapped in much the same way as a physiological
phenotype like blood pressure or heart rate. Joining gene expression and 
physiological phenotypes with genetic variation can identify genes with variants
affecting disease phenotypes.

To the simple diagram above we'll add two more details. Non-coding SNPs can 
regulate gene expression from nearby locatons on the same chromosome (in cis):

![Genetic variants like SNPs often affect gene expression locally near the gene that they regulate (in cis).](fig/cis-regulation-gene1.png){alt="Figure showing SNP regulating gene which affects disease"}

SNPs that affect gene expression from afar, often from a different chromosome 
from the gene that they regulate are called distal (trans) regulators.

![Alternatively, SNPs often affect gene expression distally from the gene that they regulate (in trans), often from a different chromosome altogether.](fig/trans-regulation-gene2.png){alt="Figure showing trans regulation"}

In this lesson we revisit genetic mapping of quantitative traits and apply its
methods to gene expression. The examples are from 
[Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.300864)
by Keller, et al. This study offers supporting evidence for type 2 
diabetes-associated loci in human GWAS, most of which affect pancreatic islet 
function. The study assessed pancreatic islet gene expression in Diversity 
Outbred mice on either a regular chow or high-fat, high-sugar diet. Islet mRNA 
abundance was quantified and analyzed, and the study identified more than 18,000 
eQTL peaks.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- An expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) explains part of the variation 
in gene expression.
- Traditional linkage and association mapping can be applied to gene expression 
traits (transcripts).
- Genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that 
underlie eQTL illuminate transcriptional regulation and variation.
