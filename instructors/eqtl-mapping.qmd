## Single-gene diseases

![Single-gene diseases like CF are relatively well understood. Created in [BioRender](https://BioRender.com)](../episodes/fig/cystic-fibrosis.png){fig-alt="Single-gene diseases like CF are relatively well understood. Created in BioRender" width="75%"}

::: notes
Differences in disease risk between individuals caused by genetic variants.\
Identifying effects of variants = key to understanding disease and biology.\
Effects of variants in many single-gene disorders like CF generally well-characterized and disease biology well understood.\
In CF, mutations in coding region of CFTR gene alter 3-D structure of chloride channel proteins in epithelial cells, affecting chloride, sodium and potassium transport in lungs, pancreas and skin.\
Path from mutation to altered protein to disease phenotype is relatively simple and well understood.\
Single-gene diseases not well-characterized or understood are a focus of rare disease research.

## Common diseases involve many genes interacting with the environment

![Figures showing the GWAS Catalog](../episodes/fig/gwas-catalog.png)

::: notes
Common human disorders involve many genes interacting with each other and with environment. Path from a single mutation to protein to disease phenotype not straightforward\
Cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, diabetes and cancer are complex and mechanisms not well understood. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) associates genetic variants with disease. Tempting to think that genetic variants fall in coding regions. However, most GWAS variants for common diseases like diabetes located in **non-coding** regions\
These variants likely to fall in regulatory sequences involved in gene regulation.

## Common diseases = tiny effect sizes

## What are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)?

::: notes
Gene regulation controls the quantity, timing and locale of gene expression. Analyzing genome variants through gene expression = expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. An eQTL is a locus that explains variation in transcript abundance\
Specifically, genetic variants underlying eQTL explain variation in gene expression levels. Shown here is a non-coding SNP that influences expression of gene 1, which in turn affects a phenotype. Not shown is the protein product of this gene. Since we are focusing on gene expression the figure is simplified to only include mRNA and not protein. Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and association mapping can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts) in eQTL analysis. This means gene expression can be mapped in the same way as a physiological phenotype like blood pressure or heart rate. Joining gene expression and physiological phenotypes with genetic variation can identify genes with variants affecting disease phenotypes.

## Local eQTL

::: notes
To the simple diagram above we'll add two more details. Non-coding SNPs can regulate gene expression from nearby locations on the same chromosome. These are called local eQTL.
:::

## Distal eQTL

::: notes
SNPs that affect gene expression from afar, often from a different chromosome from the gene that they regulate are called distal regulators.

## An eQTL study

![Figure showing Type 2 diabetes and insulin.](../episodes/fig/healthy-vs-T2D.png)

Created in [BioRender](https://BioRender.com)

::: notes
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often identify variants in non-coding regions of the genome, indicating that regulation of gene expression predominates in common diseases like type II diabetes.\
In type II diabetes (T2D) the pancreas produces less insulin and the body becomes less responsive to insulin.

## Pancreatic islets and T2D

![Figure showing the Islet of Langerhans in the pancreas, which is composed of alpha, beta, delta and gamma cells.](../episodes/fig/pancreatic-islet.png)

Created in [BioRender](https://BioRender.com)

::: notes
Most of the more than 100 genetic loci associated with T2D affect the function of pancreatic islets.\
This study offers supporting evidence for T2D-associated loci in human GWAS, most of which affect pancreatic islet function.\
Pancreatic islet cells produce endocrine hormones including insulin.\
A feedback loop of glucose and insulin activates beta cells that produce insulin and inhibits alpha cells in the pancreas.

## Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function

![Figure showing glucose and insulin changes over time.](../episodes/fig/gtt_auc_example.png)

::: notes
Susceptibility to type II diabetes (T2D) increases with obesity, such that T2D-associated genetic loci operate mainly under conditions of obesity. (See [Keller, Mark P et al. “Genetic Drivers of Pancreatic Islet Function.” Genetics vol. 209,1 (2018): 335-356](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5937189/)).\
Like most GWAS loci, the T2D-associated genetic loci identified from GWAS have very small effect sizes and odds ratios just slightly more than 1.\
This study explored islet gene expression in diabetes.\
The authors hypothesized that gene expression changes in response to dietary challenge would reveal signaling pathways involved in stress responses.\
The expression of many genes often map to the same locus, indicating that expression of these genes is controlled in common.\
If their mRNAs encode proteins with common physiological functions, the function of the controlling gene(s) is revealed.\
Variation in expression of the controlling gene(s), rather than a genetic variant, can be tested as an immediate cause of a disease-related phenotype.

In this study, Diversity Outbred (DO) mice were fed a high-fat, high-sugar diet as a stressor, sensitizing the mice to develop diabetic traits.\
Body weight and plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride measurements were taken biweekly.\
Food intake could be measured since animals were individually housed.\
A glucose tolerance test at 18 weeks of age provided measurement of dynamic glucose and insulin changes at 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after glucose administration.\
Area under the curve (AUC) was determined from these time points for both plasma glucose and insulin levels.

## Genome scans

![Insulin AUC QTL plot](../episodes/fig/insulin-auc-lod-plot.png)

::: notes
Genome scans were performed with the leave-one-chromosome-out (LOCO) method for kinship correction.\
Sex and experimental cohort (DO wave) were used as covariates.\
The results of one scan for insulin area under the curve (AUC) is shown here with a strong peak on chromosome 11.\
In this lesson, we will look into genes located under this peak.
