Analyzing the association between gene expression and genetic variants is known as 
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping. eQTL mapping searches for associations 
between the expression of one or more genes and a genetic locus. Specifically, genetic 
variants underlying eQTL peak explain some of the variation in gene expression levels. 
eQTL studies can reveal the architecture of quantitative traits, connect DNA sequence 
variation to phenotypic variation, and shed light on transcriptional regulation and 
regulatory variation. Traditional analytic techniques like linkage and association mapping 
can be applied to thousands of gene expression traits (transcripts) in eQTL analysis, such 
that gene expression can be mapped in much the same way as a physiological phenotype like 
blood pressure or heart rate. Joining gene expression and physiological phenotypes with 
genetic variation can identify genes with variants affecting disease phenotypes.
