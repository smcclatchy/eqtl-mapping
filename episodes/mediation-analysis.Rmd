## Introduction

GWAS studies show that most disease-associated variants are found in non-coding
regions. This fact leads to the idea that regulation of gene expression is an
important mechanism enabling genetic variants to affect complex traits. 
Mediation analysis can identify a causal chain from genetic variants to 
molecular and clinical phenotypes. The graphic below shows complete mediation,
in which a predictor variable does not directly impact the response variable.
Rather, it directly influences the mediator (path a). The mediator has a direct 
impact on the response variable (path b). We would see (path c) the relationship 
between predictor and response, not knowing that a mediator intervenes in this
relationship.

![In complete mediation an predictor variable influences a response variable indirectly through a mediator variable.](fig/mediation-analysis.png){alt="Mediation Analysis"}

Mediation analysis is widely used in the social sciences including psychology. 
In biomedicine, mediation analysis has been employed to investigate how gene 
expression mediates the effects of genetic variants on complex phenotypes and 
disease.

For example, a genetic variant (non-coding SNP) indirectly regulates expression 
of gene 2 through a mediator, gene 1. The SNP regulates expression of gene 1 in 
cis, and expression of gene 1 influences expression of gene 2 in trans.  

![A non-coding SNP affects expression of gene 1 in cis. Gene 1 mediates expression of gene 2.](fig/mediation-trans-noncoding-SNP.png){alt="mediation figure"}

Instead of the expression of one gene impacting another, expression of gene 1 in
the graphic above could impact a physiological phenotype like blood glucose. 
Expression of gene 1 would mediate the relationship between the non-coding SNP
and the glucose phenotype.

Gene Akr1e1 is located on chromosome 13 in mouse.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge 1: Interpreting *Akr1e1* eQTL plot.

How would you interpret the *Akr1e1* LOD plot above? On which chromosome(s) 
would you expect to find the driver gene(s)? The SNP(s)?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

*Ark1e1* expression is regulated by some variants on chromosome 13 and other 
variants on chromosome 4. The largest driver gene occurs on chromosome 4 because
the LOD peak is higher there, indicating that the genotype on chromosome 4 
explains more of the variance than the one on chromosome 13.

Myo15b is located on chromosome 11.

### Challenge 2: Interpreting *Myo15b* eQTL plot.

How would you interpret the *Myo15b* LOD plot above? On which chromosome(s) 
would you expect to find the driver gene(s)? The SNP(s)?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

*Myo15b* is regulated by variants on chromosome 2 because the largest LOD peak
is located there.

## Using Gene Expression as a Covariate

When we are searching for a gene whose expression influences a physiological 
phenotype, we may not be looking for a missense SNP in the the gene. Instead,
we may be looking for a SNP in a regulatory region which influence the 
expression of the gene, which in turn influences the physiological phenotype.
However, the exact sequence of regulatory regions and the genes that they 
influence is not as well annotated as protein-coding regions of genes. So, 
rather than search for the regulatory SNP, we will search for genes which 
influence the trait and we will not seek to identify the causal SNP.

Next, we are going to create our own mediation function. We will walk through it
step-by-step so that you understand why we are performing each step.

Mediation analysis bring together a lot of information, to the function will
have a LOT of variables.

First, we need to pass in the chromosome, position, and LOD score of the QTL
at which we are mapping. Remember, in a mediation scan, we map a phenotype at 
**ONE** locus and use different genes as covariates.

Next, since we are mapping, we need to pass in the genoprobs, the original 
phenotype which produced the QTL peak, the kinship matrices, the covariates
matrix, and the markers map. In this case, our "phenotype" will be PC1 from the
genes in the chromosome 2 eQTL hotspot.

The last two arguments will be the expression matrix and the gene annotation.

With all of those pieces in place, we will build the function below.


```{r mediation_fxn}
# Perform mediation analysis on one locus using all of the available genes on
# the corresponding chromosome.
# qtl_chr: character string containing one of the chromosome names in genoprobs.
#      Must be 1:19 or X.
# qtl_pos: floating point number that is the Mb position of the QTL to map at.
# qtl_lod: floating point number that is the LOD score at the QTL.
# genoprobs: qtl2-style list containing genoprobs for all chromosomes.
# pheno: numeric matrix containing one column with the phenotype values. Sample
#        IDs must be in rownames.
# K: qtl2-style list of LOCO kinship matrices.
# addcovar: numeric matrix of additive covariate created with something like
#           model.matrix(). Must be ready to pass into scan1() directly.
# map: qtl2-style list containing marker map. Markers must match the markers in
#      genoprobs.
# expr: numeric matrix of normalized expression values. Sample in rows and genes
#       in columns.
# annot: data.frame containing the gene annotation. Genes in rows must be in the
#        same order as the genes in columns in "expr".
mediation <- function(qtl_chr, qtl_pos, qtl_lod, genoprobs, pheno, K, addcovar, 
                      map, expr, annot) {

  # Get the genoprobs at the QTL peak.
  pr <- pull_genoprobpos(genoprobs = probs,
                         map       = map, 
                         chr       = qtl_chr, 
                         pos       = qtl_pos)

  # Get the genes on chromosome 11.
  genes_chr <- annot |>
                 filter(chr == qtl_chr) |>
                 pull(gene_id)
  expr_chr  <- expr_rz[, genes_chr]

  # Subset the covariates to include only the samples in the expression data.
  addcovar_expr <- addcovar[rownames(expr_chr),]

  # Create the results.
  results <- data.frame(gene_id  = colnames(expr_chr),
                        base_lod = qtl_lod,
                        med_lod  = 0) |>
             left_join(select(annot, gene_id, symbol, middle))
  
  # Loop through each gene, add it to the covariates, and map it at the QTL 
  # marker.
  t_init <- proc.time()[3]
  
  for(i in 1:ncol(expr_chr)) {
    
    # Show progress.
    if(i %% 50 == 0) {
      
      t2 <- proc.time()[3]
      print(paste(i, 'of', ncol(expr_chr), ":", (t2 - t_init), "seconds elapsed."))
      
    } # for(i)
  
    # Create covariates with the current gene's expression.
    addcovar_tmp = cbind(addcovar_expr, expr_chr[,i])

    # Fit the QTL model at the QTL marker with the new covariates.
    mod <- fit1(genoprobs = pr,
                pheno     = pheno,
                kinship   = K[[qtl_chr]],
                addcovar  = addcovar_tmp)
  
    # Add the LOD to the results.
    results$med_lod[i] <- mod$lod
    
  } # for(i)

  # Subtract the meditation LODs from the baseline LOD.
  results <- results |>
               mutate(lod_drop = med_lod - base_lod)
  
  # Return the results.
  return(results)

} # mediation()
```


```{r mediation_chr2_hotspot,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
qtl_pos <- mean(hotspots[["2"]]$qtl_pos)

med_2 <- mediation(qtl_chr  = "2", 
                   qtl_pos  = qtl_pos,
                   qtl_lod  = max(pc1_lod), 
                   genoprobs = probs, 
                   pheno    = pc1_2, 
                   K        = K, 
                   addcovar = addcovar, 
                   map      = map, 
                   expr     = expr_rz, 
                   annot    = annot)
```

Now that we have the change in LOD scores associated with using each gene as a
covariate, we can plot the LOD change along chromosome 11.

```{r plot_med,fig.width=8,fig.height=6}
end  <- ceiling(max(med_2$middle / 10))

med_2 |>
  ggplot(aes(middle, lod_drop)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:end * 10) +
    labs(title = "Mediation Analysis for Chr 2 PC1",
         x     = "Position (Mb)",
         y     = "LOD Drop") +
    theme(size = element_text(size = 20))
```

In the plot above, the position of each gene along chromosome 2 is shown on the
X-axis and the LOD drop is shown on the Y-axes. Most genes don't change the LOD
score by very much. It seems that, by chance, LOD scores can vary by plus or
minus 3. In this case, we are searching for genes which decrease the LOD score
by the largest amount. In this case, there is one gene which reduces the LOD .

```{r med_low_lod}
med_2 |>
  filter(lod_drop < -20)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

#### Challenge 3: Keller et al chromosome 2 hotspot candidate gene?

Look at Figure 4C in 
[Keller et al](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5937189/) and see 
which gene the selected in their mediaiton analysis.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

The authors found that *Hnf4a* reduces the LOD more than any other gene.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

#### Challenge 4: Look up *Dpp4* in [Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) 
or 
[Alliance Genome](https://www.alliancegenome.org/) and see if it has any
known association with type 2 diabetes or insulin metabolism.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

[Alliance Genome](https://www.alliancegenome.org/gene/MGI:94919) says that 
"Human ortholog(s) of this gene implicated in ... type 2 diabetes mellitus."

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Let's look more closely at *Hnf4a*. First, let's map the expresson of *Hnf4a*.

```{r map_hnf4a}
hnf4a     <- annot[annot$symbol == "Hnf4a",]$gene_id
hnf4a_lod <- scan1(genoprobs = probs,
                  pheno     = expr_rz[,hnf4a, drop = FALSE],
                  kinship   = K,
                  addcovar  = addcovar)
plot(hnf4a_lod, map, main = "Hnf4a Genome Scan")
```

In the plot above, we can see that *Hnf4a* has a QTL peak on chromosome 2.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

#### Challenge 5: Find the *Hnf4a* QTL peak location.

Use find_peaks() to find the position of the *Hnf4a* QTL peak. What kind of eQTL
would you call this peak? Local or distant? How does this peak location compare
with the location of the chromosome 2 eQTL hotspot?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r challenge3}
find_peaks(hnf4a_lod, map = map, threshold = 8)
```

*Hnf4a* has a QTL peak on chromosome 2 at 164 Mb. 

This is the same position as the chromosome 2 eQTL hotspot.

Since *Hnf4a* is located at 163.4 Mb and its largest eQTL is located at 164 Mb,
we could call this a local eQTL.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::




These are the primary steps in mediation analysis. As you can see, sometimes,
meditation analysis can point to a candidate gene that is plausible. It is 
always important to remember that there may be more than one causal gene and
that causal genes may contain missense or splice SNPs which affect gene
expression levels.

### Interactive QTL Viewer

The [QTL Viewer](https://churchilllab.jax.org/qtlviewer/attie/islets#) 
for the Attie islet data integrates mediation into exploration of the data. 
Below, mediation analysis identifies gene Hnf4a as the chromosome 2 gene that 
impacts Myo15b expression.

![Mediating expression of Myo15b identifies Hnf4a as the gene that drops the LOD score from greater than 70 to less than 50.](fig/mediation-Hnf4a-Myo15b.png){alt="Hnf4a mediation"}

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

#### Challenge 6: Perform mediation at another eQTL hotspot.

Select another eQTL hotspot and perform mediation analysis. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: solution

Set "hot_chr" to one of the other eQTL hotspot locations: 5, 7, or 11

First, we look at the positions of the eQTL in this region.

```{r challenge6a}
hot_chr <- "11"
hot     <- hotspots[[hot_chr]]
plot(table(hot$qtl_pos), las = 2)
```

Next, we subset the genes to select ones which have eQTL at the same location.
Some of the eQTL hotspots have large numbers of of genes at more than one 
marker. Feel free to explore different markers. Below, we sort the markers by
the number of genes with eQTL at each marker so that we can select ones to
pursue.

```{r}
sort(table(hot$qtl_pos))
```

Set the thresholds below to match the markers which you would like to include.

```{r challenge6b}
hot <- hot[hot$qtl_pos >= 71.3 & hot$qtl_pos <= 71.7,]
nrow(hot)
```

Next, we get the expression of the genes at the marker(s) we are pursuing and
calculate the first pricipal component.

```{r challenge6c}
expr_hot <- expr_rz[,hot$gene_id]
hot_pca  <- princomp(expr_hot)
pc1_hot  <- hot_pca$scores[,1,drop = FALSE]
```

Plot the genome scan of PC1.

```{r challenge6d}
pc1_lod <- scan1(genoprobs = probs,
                 pheno     = pc1_hot,
                 kinship   = K,
                 addcovar  = addcovar)
plot_scan1(pc1_lod, map, main = paste("Chr", hot_chr))
```

At this point, we have everything that we need to perform mediation analysis.

```{r challeng6e}
qtl_pos <- median(hot$qtl_pos)

med_hot <- mediation(qtl_chr  = hot_chr, 
                     qtl_pos  = qtl_pos,
                     qtl_lod  = max(pc1_lod), 
                     genoprobs = probs, 
                     pheno    = pc1_hot, 
                     K        = K, 
                     addcovar = addcovar, 
                     map      = map, 
                     expr     = expr_rz, 
                     annot    = annot)
```

Now that we have completed the mediation analysis, we plot the results.

```{r challeng6f,fig.width=8,fig.height=6}
end  <- ceiling(max(med_hot$middle / 10))

med_hot |>
  ggplot(aes(middle, lod_drop)) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:end * 10) +
    labs(title = str_c("Mediation Analysis for Chr ", hot_chr, " PC1"),
         x     = "Position (Mb)",
         y     = "LOD Drop") +
    theme(size = element_text(size = 20))
```

Let's list the genes with LOD drops less than -10.

```{r challeng6g}
filter(med_hot, lod_drop < -10)
```

here are three genes with large LOD drops. In figure S7 of 
[Keller et al](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5937189/), 
they select *Sat2* as a candidate gene. 

But notice that there are also gene with large LOD increases. Let's list out
the genes with LOD increases over 12.

```{r challeng6h}
filter(med_hot, lod_drop > 12)
```

There are three genes with large LOD increase. If a LOD drop means that the
gene is absorbing variance and may be a causal mediator, what does a LOD 
increase mean?

Let's start by looking at the allele effects of the hotspot PC1 at the QTL.

```{r}
pr      <- pull_genoprobpos(genoprobs = probs, map = map, chr = hot_chr, pos = qtl_pos)

pc1_eff <- fit1(genoprobs = pr,
                pheno     = pc1_hot,
                kinship   = K[[hot_chr]],
                addcovar  = addcovar)
plot(1:8, pc1_eff$coef[1:8], xaxt = "n", main = "PC1", xlab = "Founder",
     ylab = "Allele Effects")
axis(side = 1, at = 1:8, labels = names(pc1_eff$coef[1:8]))
```

From the plot above, we can see that CAST (F) and PWK (G) have lower effects
than the other founders. Remember that the sign of the PC is arbitrary, so the
effects may be positive.

Next, let's look at the allele effects of the gene with the highest LOD increase,
*Rnf167*.

```{r}
gene_id  <- annot[annot$symbol == "Rnf167",]$gene_id

gene_lod <- fit1(genoprobs  = pr,
                  pheno     = expr_rz[,gene_id, drop = FALSE],
                  kinship   = K[[hot_chr]], 
                  addcovar  = addcovar)
plot(1:8, gene_lod$coef[1:8],  xaxt = "n", main = "Rnf167", xlab = "Founder",
     ylab = "Allele Effects")
axis(side = 1, at = 1:8, labels = names(pc1_eff$coef[1:8]))
```

*Rnf167* has allele effects which seem quite correlated with PC1. Both CAST (F) and
PWK (G) have different allele effects from the other strains.

Next, let's look at *Sat2*, which is the gene with the largest LOD **drop**.

```{r}
gene_id  <- annot[annot$symbol == "Sat2",]$gene_id
pr       <- pull_genoprobpos(genoprobs = probs, map = map, chr = hot_chr, pos = qtl_pos)
gene_lod <- fit1(genoprobs  = pr,
                  pheno     = expr_rz[,gene_id, drop = FALSE],
                  kinship   = K[[hot_chr]], 
                  addcovar  = addcovar)
plot(gene_lod$coef[1:8],xaxt = "n", main = "Sat2", xlab = "Founder",
     ylab = "Allele Effects")
axis(side = 1, at = 1:8, labels = names(pc1_eff$coef[1:8]))
```

The allele effects for *Sat2* appear to be less correlated, with PWK (G) having
lower effects than the other strains.

Let's look at the correlation of *Sat2*, *Rnf167*, and the hotspot PC1.

```{r}
expr_tmp <- expr_rz[,c(annot[annot$symbol == "Sat2",]$gene_id, annot[annot$symbol == "Rnf167",]$gene_id)]
colnames(expr_tmp) <- c("Sat2", "Rnf167")
expr_tmp <- cbind(expr_tmp, pc1_hot)
cor(expr_tmp)
```

Both genes have almost identical correlation (0.41) with PC1, but are not
strongly correlated with each other (-0.1).

Let's look at the relationship between the correlation between PC1 and all of
the genes on chromosome 11.

```{r fig.height=6fig.width=6}
expr_11 <- expr_rz[,annot[annot$chr == '11',]$gene_id]
cor_11  <- cor(pc1_hot, expr_11)
plot(med_hot$lod_drop, cor_11, xlab = "LOD Drop", ylab = "Correlation")
```

There seems to be a relationship between the absolute LOD drop and the 
correlation between the gene and PC1.

Mediation analysis is one way of identifying candidate genes under QTL peaks.
In this episode, we have focused on eQTL hotspots, but you could do this with
physiological phenotypes as well. 


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Mediation analysis investigates an intermediary between an independent 
variable and its effect on a dependent variable.
- Mediation analysis is used in high-throughput genomics studies to identify 
molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression or methylation traits, that 
mediate the effect of genetic variation on disease phenotypes or other outcomes 
of interest.
